Data I want here:

For all repos from http://cache.uithub.com/repos/janwilmake:

- regular details
- domain.forgithub.com
- summary of openapi of that domain (if any)
- screenshot of homepage
- category stack (generated with LLM)
- actions summary / success
- logo of deployment provider

Then, show this in a vercel-like way, but with the added advantage that it's super reasy to fetch any additional datapoint and view it for each repo.
