## githubwatch

1. Actually subscribe to watching all repos upon login (via a waituntil+scheduled api call).
2. Ensure per user I know the source (where/when they logged in)
3. Ensure the watching all lands in cache
4. Watch also triggers calculating all repo stuff, so we end up with a file of all repos + calcs that is refreshed each time something changes. 🐐

At data.forgithub or join.forgithub, idontrememba,.... ensure we have the most fresh data for the important datapoints available
