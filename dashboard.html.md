Data I want here:

For all repos from http://cache.uithub.com/repos/janwilmake:

- regular details
- domain.forgithub.com
- summary of openapi of that domain (if any)
- screenshot of homepage
- category stack (generated with LLM)
- actions summary / success
- logo of deployment provider

Layout:

- show this in a vercel-like way
- select to fetch any additional datapoint and view it for each repo
- grouped by domain and category
- there's a chatbox to start a new task for one or more repos
- each item has buttons to get datapoint, or go to github/uithub/website/openapi/chat
